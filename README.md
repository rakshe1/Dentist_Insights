# Dentist_Insights

#### Problem Statement:

We are a dental practice located in the UK. There are 10 dentists working in the practice. 5 of them are salaried (fixed) and 5 are paid between 40 - 55% commission (variable) based on the surgery value (revenue) they generate every calendar month.
At the end of every calendar month the business owner would like to have a performance review with each dentist. She would like to base her discussion around a dashboard / report that clearly showcase the performance of each dentist.
Based on the attached spreadsheet please generate a monthly report / dashboard (you are free to use any tool that you think is suitable).
Please include the monthly revenue figures surplus and/or shortfall in your report per dentist and also for the company.
You are free to add more insights into the report as appropriate.

I have worked with a real dataset of monthly performance data for a dental practice, which I used to create a comprehensive monthly dashboard. From this analysis, I was able to extract key insights and develop actionable recommendations for the business owner to improve performance and drive growth.
